Extract it, and move ExtractHere folder somewhere in your user directory (`%localappdata%\programs`)

## Usage

Add "Extract here" entry in classic context menu (windows 10, windows 11 with show more options):

- Right click on `ExtractHere.exe` > run as administrator.  
- You can then add or remove the entry.

/!\ If you move the program folder AFTER adding the context menu entry, you wont be able to delete it later.  
Be sure to move the folder before creating entry.

For windows 11 new context menu you can use "Custom Context Menu" from microsoft store (Free, 1 dolar if you like it to help the creator)

You can now extract zipfiles in one click (and faster).
